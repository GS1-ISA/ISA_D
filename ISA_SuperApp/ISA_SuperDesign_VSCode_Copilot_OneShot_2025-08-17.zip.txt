Here’s a single-package, Copilot-deployable build tailored for VS Code on macOS. It includes the one-shot prompt, VS Code configs, CI matrix for macOS (arm64/x64/universal), and scripts that stand up everything end-to-end.

What’s inside (high-impact additions)
	•	One-shot Copilot prompt: COPILOT_DEPLOY.prompt.md
Paste into Copilot Chat to orchestrate the entire deployment from inside VS Code.
	•	VS Code workspace setup:
	•	.vscode/extensions.json (recommended extensions incl. Copilot, Python, Ruff, Docker, GitHub Actions, Prettier)
	•	.vscode/settings.json (venv, pytest, format-on-save, Ruff fix-on-save)
	•	Tooling & quality gates:
	•	requirements-dev.txt, pyproject.toml (Black, Ruff, pytest config), .pre-commit-config.yaml
	•	scripts/setup_dev.sh (dev deps + pre-commit)
	•	One-command automation:
	•	scripts/all_in_one_setup.sh: bootstraps venv, dev tools, tests, VS Code setup, Electron deps, universal DMG build, and (optionally) GitHub publish via gh
	•	scripts/bootstrap_vscode.sh: installs VS Code extensions (uses code CLI if available)
	•	scripts/publish_github.sh: creates a private repo with gh, pushes main, ready for CI
	•	scripts/diagnose.sh: prints system/ports/versions for quick debug
	•	App + CI already wired:
	•	Electron package.json configured for universal DMG
	•	GitHub Actions matrix builds: arm64, x64, universal (three artifacts named isa-<version>-macOS_*)
	•	FastAPI with /health + /version; smoke test script and Makefile targets (setup, test, run, package-macos(-universal))

How to use in VS Code (Mac)
	1.	Open the folder in VS Code.
	2.	Open Copilot Chat (⌥⌘I or the Copilot icon).
	3.	Paste the entire contents of COPILOT_DEPLOY.prompt.md.
Copilot will orchestrate the following in the integrated terminal:
	•	bash scripts/all_in_one_setup.sh (bootstraps, tests, builds universal DMG)
	•	Optional GitHub creation/push if you set:

export REPO_OWNER="<your_org_or_username>"
export REPO_NAME="isa-superdesign"
export REPO_VISIBILITY="private"
export PUBLISH_GH=1

then re-run:

bash scripts/all_in_one_setup.sh


	•	Confirms CI artifacts (arm64, x64, universal) after the push

Tip: If the code CLI isn’t on PATH, Copilot will show the VS Code command palette step: “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ in PATH”.

Manual fallback (if you prefer explicit commands)

# 0) Optional system prep
xcode-select --install || true
# (Optional) brew install node@20

# 1) Bootstrap, dev tools, tests, build universal DMG
bash scripts/all_in_one_setup.sh

# 2) (Optional) Publish to GitHub with gh
export REPO_OWNER="<your_org_or_username>"
export REPO_NAME="isa-superdesign"
export REPO_VISIBILITY="private"
export PUBLISH_GH=1
bash scripts/all_in_one_setup.sh

The DMG ends up in:

desktop/electron/dist/*.dmg

The CI workflow lives at:

.github/workflows/ci.yml

and publishes three artifacts per run:
	•	isa-<version>-macOS_arm64
	•	isa-<version>-macOS_x64
	•	isa-<version>-macOS_universal

⸻

Verification checklist (turn-key signals)
	•	make test passes, scripts/smoke_test.py reports:
	•	Health OK, version shows 2025.08.17-turnkey.1
	•	make run serves UI at http://127.0.0.1:8787/ui/users
	•	curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/health → {"status":"ok", ...}
	•	desktop/electron/dist/*.dmg opens and launches the app
	•	GitHub Actions run shows 3 macOS artifacts with the correct names

Notes & boundaries
	•	Secrets: keep them in .env (use .env.example as a guide). The package never commits secrets.
	•	Code signing / notarization: out of scope by default. If you want Gatekeeper-clean releases, I can add electron-builder signing + gh secret set scaffolding.
	•	Devcontainer: not included to avoid Docker coupling (given your earlier Traefik/Docker issues). I can add it if you want a reproducible containerized dev environment.

If you want me to wire release automation (create GitHub Release and upload all three DMGs on tag), say the word—I’ll fold it into the CI and update the prompt accordingly.
